# Reflective Essay 2 Plan — Team 5: Green @ Community

Date: 2025-10-14

## 1) What the essay must include
- Length: ~200 words (180–220 ok), first person, critical reflection.
- Structure:
  - Introduction (30–40 words): Context (course + Team 5 focus).
  - Main body (120–140 words): Choose 2–3 reflection points below.
  - Conclusion (30–40 words): Key takeaways + future application.
- Focus: Government enquiries and AI assistance.
- Output path: `vibeCoding101/Part4GovEnquiryReflectEssay/ReflectiveEssay2_[YourName].md`
- Deadline: 17 Oct 2025, 11:00 PM (see instructions file).

## 2) Evidence base to cite (from repo)
- Team project: `Team5_GreenCommunity/README.md`, `Team5_GreenCommunity/Project_Roadmap_Team5.md`
- Enquiry plan: `vibeCoding101/Part1ReadingEditingFiles/planGovEnquiries.md`
- Assignment guide: `vibeCoding101/Part4GovEnquiryReflectEssay/INSTRUCTION_ReflectiveEssay.md`

Suggested specifics to reference:
- Missing data you identified: participation + demographics, pre/post environmental impact, resource allocation, community feedback, evaluation reports.
- Target departments: EPD, C&SD, Home Affairs.
- Model choice logic: regression (effectiveness factors) vs simulation (engagement + resources).
- Enquiry template points (data items, evaluation criteria, governance limits).

## 3) Reflection angles (pick 2–3)
1) Data governance & access
- Open vs request-only data; practical access gaps; implications for analysis.
2) Enquiry drafting skill
- Defining decision-relevant variables; prioritising metrics; professional tone.
3) AI collaboration
- What the agent accelerated; limitations (access barriers, governance constraints); how you adapted.
4) Project insights
- How requested data strengthens evaluation; backup plans if denied (e.g., use C&SD demographics, qualitative review); impact on view of data-driven policy.

## 4) Three thesis options
- A) Translating our roadmap into precise enquiries exposed gaps between open data and evaluation needs, guiding a staged data strategy for Green @ Community.
- B) AI support sped up scoping, but governance constraints required robust backups and clearer success metrics.
- C) Focusing on decision-relevant variables (participation, impact, resources) shifted me from generic effectiveness claims to measurable criteria.

## 5) 200-word outline with sentence stems
- Introduction (1–2 sentences)
  - "In GCAP3226, my Team 5 project examines how EPD uses data to design and evaluate Green @ Community programmes. This reflection covers drafting government enquiries, data access realities, and what I learned about data-driven policy."
- Main body (3–5 sentences; choose 2–3 angles)
  - Data governance: "I found that headline programme pages exist, but actionable metrics (participation by demographics, pre/post impact, site-level resources, evaluation criteria) are not fully open and likely need Code on Access requests."
  - Enquiry drafting: "Turning our roadmap into specific requests forced me to define variables and success criteria, prioritising decision-relevant data over ‘nice to have’."
  - AI collaboration: "The agent produced a clean enquiry plan and structure, but it could not bypass access barriers, so I documented backups using C&SD demographics and course materials."
- Conclusion (1–2 sentences)
  - "I shifted from general advocacy to measurable, auditable requests aligned with our modelling choices (regression vs simulation). These habits will guide future policy work when open data is partial and governance constraints are real."

## 6) Quick checklist before submission
- [ ] 180–220 words, first person, concrete examples from Team 5.
- [ ] At least one insight on data access and one on enquiry drafting.
- [ ] One note on AI help + limitation and your adaptation.
- [ ] Saved to the required path with your name.
- [ ] Commit + push and post link per instructions.

## 7) Optional next actions
- I can scaffold `ReflectiveEssay2_[YourName].md` with placeholders and the outline above.
- I can also extract 2–3 quotes or bullets from your enquiry draft/notes if you have them, to personalise the essay further.
