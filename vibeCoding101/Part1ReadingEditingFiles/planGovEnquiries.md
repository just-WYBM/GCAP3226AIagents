# Plan for Sending Enquiries to Government Departments (Green @ Community Project)

## 1. Project Analysis
The project focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of Green @ Community initiatives and green policy implementation in Hong Kong, with emphasis on:
- Program effectiveness and impact assessment
- Community engagement and participation optimization
- Resource allocation and policy implementation strategies
- Success factors for community-based environmental initiatives

## 2. Missing Data Identified
- Program participation rates and demographic breakdowns
- Environmental impact metrics (before/after program implementation)
- Resource allocation data for Green @ Community programs
- Community engagement and feedback records
- Socioeconomic and demographic data for participating communities
- Policy implementation timelines and evaluation reports
- Barriers to participation and program adoption
- Data on optimization models used for resource allocation and engagement

## 3. Government Departments to Contact
- **Environmental Protection Department (EPD)**: For program data, impact metrics, resource allocation, policy implementation records, and evaluation reports.
- **Census and Statistics Department**: For demographic and socioeconomic data to correlate with program participation and effectiveness.
- **Home Affairs Department**: For community engagement records and feedback data.

## 4. Enquiry Plan
- Draft formal requests under the Code on Access to Information.
- Specify the exact data points needed (see above).
- Request both quantitative data and any available reports/summaries.
- Ask about data collection methods, privacy limitations, and evaluation criteria.
- Inquire about models or strategies used for optimizing community engagement and resource allocation.

## 5. Example Enquiry Template (Environmental Protection Department)
Subject: Request for Information under the Code on Access to Information: Green @ Community Program Data and Evaluation

To: Access to Information Officer, Environmental Protection Department

Dear Access to Information Officer,

We are undergraduate students from Hong Kong Baptist University enrolled in GCAP3226: Data-Driven Government. As part of our final project, we are studying the decision-making processes related to Green @ Community program design, implementation, and evaluation.

Under the principles of the Code on Access to Information, we would be grateful if you could provide us with the following information:
1. What specific quantitative data points (e.g., program participation rates, environmental impact metrics, resource allocation data) are used to inform Green @ Community program decisions?
2. Could you provide any public reports or policy documents that outline the evaluation criteria and standard operating procedures for these programs?
3. What models or strategies are used to optimize community engagement and resource allocation?
4. Are there any privacy or data governance limitations we should be aware of when requesting or analyzing this data?

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,
GCAP3226 Team 5
