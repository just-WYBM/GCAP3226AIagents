## Reflective Essay on Drafting Government Enquiries

In composing the formal enquiry email to the EPD for Green@Community data, I encountered stark limitations in Hong Kong's public data access. While data.gov.hk provided basic recycling facility geolocation, granular statistics on citizen participation, facility usage, and cost breakdowns were absent, pushing us toward direct data requests. This first-time experience of requesting data from public sector body, surprised me with how precision shapes outcomes, vague request risks delays or denials, teaching me to clarify our academic purpose, justify needs for evaluating impact and cost-effectiveness, and navigate privacy constraints.

Collaborating with AI deepened this learning, while challenging my prompting skills. It transformed my scattered ideas into structured bullet points and formal email. Yet, unclear prompts initially yielded suboptimal results, teaching me the need for prompt engineering and human oversight to ensure quality. By leveraging instruction files and AI agent, I learnt professional communication skills from AI, emphasizing formal tone, structured breakdowns, and strategic requests (like seeking store floor area to estimate rental cost). Tied to participatory policy analysis, it underscored how restricted data access hinders citizen-led evaluations, directly relating to our team project on advocating data-driven improvements for Green@Community's effectiveness.

Ultimately, this process equips me to use AI for efficient work, upcoming analysis for policy advocacy, and streamlined workflows, while remaining precise and ethical.
