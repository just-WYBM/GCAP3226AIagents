## Reflective Essay on Drafting Government Enquiries

Exploring Hong Kong's data governance for our Green@Community project taught me that while the government aspires to transparency via data.gov.hk, access remains uneven. Basic data, like recycling facility locations, is readily available, but granular details on citizen participation, facility usage, and cost breakdowns are absent, forcing direct requests. This reveals frustrations in Hong Kong's public data access, limiting citizen oversight and raising concerns about resource accountability.

Drafting the enquiry to EPD posed challenges in pinpointing essential data amid scattered ideas, teaching me to break down complex needs into precise, justified requests. The process emphasized formal communication's nuances—tone, clarity, academic purpose declaration, and privacy awareness—to avoid delays, transforming my initial vagueness into structured formal government inquiry.

AI agent collaboration streamlined this; it provided ideas, transformed my scattered thoughts into structured bullet points and formal language. Unlike customized chatbot tutor, which excelled in role-playing guidance but less in searching and deep-thinking. Unclear prompts initially yielded suboptimal results, teaching me the need for prompt engineering and human oversight to ensure quality.

Potential government data would enable comprehensive understanding of current situation, supporting our data-driven recommendations for Green@Community's effectiveness. As backup if denied, we'll use strategic proxies to estimate costs and first-hand data for evaluation. This deepened my grasp of data-driven policymaking, emphasizing data access's vitality for evidence-based advocacy.
