### My personal experience and insights answering the reflection contents
below are my personal info and answer for answering the questions that bring me to write the essay, you compose essay from me with following the samples and structures above, my info below are totally messy and not organized, you write essay with proper structure and organisation just with my info used:
when we tryna search for the data that would be useful for in our project, we find that nearly no data about the green@community are opened for public access, we can only find the location and open hour data of the recycling facilities on data.gov.hk, and the general total visitor volume and recycling volume from the hong kong waste reduction website, which can only give us a very general view of the general overall outcome of the green@community, and we have to find the data from diverse places online, just some very general data are disclosed in the facebook / hong kong waste reduction website, the facebook page of which are definitely not sufficient for understanding the current situation of the green@community, and still lots of data we could not find, overall we cannot get any useful data for giving and analysing for useful insights for evaluating the impact and effectiveness of the green@community scheme, the transparency is being worried, and could raise citizens' worry about its effectiveness of impact and of using the public resources. thus we have quite a number of data both general statistics and granular datasets have to request from the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) formally. we understand that data could not be fully disclosed, but there is still too little data disclosed. so we compose an email to request for statistics and dataset we need, and this is our first time writing to public sector to request from access to data, and we find that we have to make the request clear in detailed words , vague words may leads to fail request or longer waiting time and we have to make our need and target clear beforehand, and declare our purpose of requesting for the data, and how will we use the data, to show our purpose and usage and understanding of data privacy and protection constraints, we leverage ai to inspiring us of what data we actually need, formatting the email with what we need and organise the email, while composing the email with ai, our prompt may be not that clear enough, but ai understand my prompt and organise my needs well and list out what i actually need in clear bullet points for my email, help us make our need clear, and ai help us written a formal declaration of data purpose and use, and explain our project in concise but clear words for explaining our background for requesting for data in email as well, and with our through checking, we wrote a clear and formal email for the data request to EPD, and we dont know currently to what extend gov is planning and running this scheme with data-driven insights, by requesting data from them, we could evaluate how it is going with the insights given from the data, in future ai would continuously be my great assistant on inspiring me on how could i start my work, on organising information and data i have collected and suggest analysis methods to help me make data driven and evidence based decisions, and streamline my work with ai automation in turning my not well-formatted and organised ideas into a formatted template for emails and other kinds of writings to make my work more efficient. When trying our to collaborate with ai agent to compose the formal enquiry email, i find that although ai is smart, human’s skill on using it is still very important, i have to type on-point prompts with good prompt engineering skills, telling it my background of our project, info of green@community scheme, what we would like to analyse, what data to give detailed info and describe what we want clearly in order to get what best align with what we want, i figure out that working with ai agents, clear communication is key, good prompts lead to good results, and i can make my need clear with further asking for revisions, further questions and requirements can get me better quality work, so just proactively ask for revisions and refinements till getting what i want, and the instruction file for guiding the agent to go through the Simple input → process → output structure works, it automate the process of typing what i want and ai generate something and then i copy the output to a file, the instruction file with i typing the simple input, process and output all in one instruction file automate the process. And this formal enquiry email is my first time sending email to public sector body, and with ai’s assistance, i learnt how to make my statement and request clear in order to raise my possibility of successfully getting the data we want, and it developed my skill to draft an formal email in formal tone and style with clear structure and accurate wordings, i have to break my complex needs into parts for clear reading for getting quicker response and high opportunity in getting what we want, i collaborated with ai agent to make my need well-structured from my complex idea, i worked efficiently with aitool in the professional communication, and know that it require more than just a simple email writing skill, strategy is needed as well, as we find out that some data gov may not be able to provide to us directly, so we have to ask for data that would help us estimate that data, in our case, the actual detailed money cost spent in the operation of the green@community gov may not be directly giive us even we ask for it, so we still ask for it in the email, but we also ask for side data like how many staff did they hired, the floor area of the recycling stores, and else, to estimate the cost breakdown, as the email reply takes time, we have to thing thoroughly when drafting the email to prevent we gain unsufficient data from the reply and we have not enough data for analysis, and back then, before taking this course, i only know that we could get access to data though downloading data from data.gov.hk but now from the course i learnt that we could use web crawling to automate the data access process with ai agent, streamline the process of accessing, formatting aand transferring data from APIs to csv with web crawling automation while we have to respect the access limitation in the robots.txt for stay ethical when accessing data, and as dataset from gov could abe humongous clear documentation helps a lot it could make data accessible, and ai is a great tool in assisting along the whole process from searching and formatting data with python code generated by ai agent, to analyzing, visualise and bring useful insights from data for our project, and also realise that as citizen, we should make good use of our right to ask for access to information and data with direct enquiries to request for access to those data we need but not yet disclosed publicly, and ai is a powerful tool along the whole process when i am with good skill in using it. And i have learnt that during our project, we could ustilise github repo by sharing it to collaborate with teammates, and use ai agent to divide tasks and automate some work. in future, we will use ai as tool for analysing and visulising data to draw insights for prolicy recommendation for our project, and i will make good use of ai for my future work, automate and deliver wuality work with good collaboration with ai. let ai empower me with efficient work and work effectively and assist me in making informed decisions with data. for your inforamtion, my group project is about evaluating overall effectiveness of the Green@Community, and we have defined the overall effectiveness ass two main parts which are environmental impact (participation, recyclables collected, etc.) and cost effectiveness (cost breakdowns, usage of facilities, etc), and make data-driven suggestions to government on improving the overall effectiveness of Green@Community scheme, advocate data-driven governance and decisions from the government.
